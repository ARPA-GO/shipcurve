# shipcurve
These are to calculate the ship's hydrostatic curves.

## Overview

There are already many commercial shipping programs such as Foran, Aveva Marine.  
But students and Start-up Companyfind it difficult to use these programs because of their high prices.  
And also we cannot easily use the program before it is educated.  
To solve this problem, we developed a library.  
**ARPA-GO** is python based ship calculation open source library.   
Ship calculations are divided into various fields.   
Among them, **hydrostatic curve** which is based on all ship calculations was prioritized and also provided ship calculation sheet for additional calculation.

## Getting Start
**Please refer to the manual for details.**  
### Prerequisites  
  Recommend installing anaconda and other necessary libraries.    
### Installing  
1. python  
  User wants to use python, should use editing programs such as jupyter notebook or pycharm.
